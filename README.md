remake
======

A rust library for writing maintainable regex. Regex are wonderful
things, but they lack tools for abstraction and modularity.
When regex are small, this is not a big issue, but as they grow
larger it can become frustrating to maintain them. Remake allows
you to name individual and combine them using natural syntax.
